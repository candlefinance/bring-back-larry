# Bring back Larry

In a world where Twitter users thought they could finally breathe a sigh of relief, one man had other plans. His name was Elon Musk, and he had just unleashed a new logo for the social media platform, replacing the iconic Larry the Bird with the infamous X.

Twitter users were outraged, feeling as if a part of their very identity had been stolen from them. Panic ensued, with users frantically searching for a solution to this egregious violation. But fear not, for a hero emerged from the shadows, armed with nothing but their coding skills and a fierce determination to save the day.

With the click of a button, the logo was restored to its former glory, and Twitter users could once again hold their heads high, knowing that they had prevailed against the forces of darkness. But for how long would this peace last? Only time will tell, as the battle for the soul of Twitter rages on.
